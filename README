This project was made for ICS 372.  The point of this project is to demonstrate how software design patterns such as 
the State pattern and the Singleton pattern can be used.

Another purpose of this project is to demonstrate excellent documentation skills.  Every class and aspect of this project has the correct 
documentation written with the code.

This project is a refrigerator temperature simulator.  The state of the temperature changes depending on what state the fridge is in. 
For example the refrigerator cools down if the power is on and the internal temperature is more than the desired temperature.
